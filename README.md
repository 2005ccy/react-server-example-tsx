# react-server-example-tsx

A complex example of how to do server-side rendering with
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [TypeScript](http://microsoft.github.io/typescript/) so that component code can be
shared between server and browser, fast initial page loads, search-engine-friendly pages, and of course...type safe!

This code was adapted from [react-server-example](https://github.com/mhart/react-server-example).

## Example

### Compile

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run
```sh
npm start
```
